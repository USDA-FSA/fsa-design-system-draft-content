## About

Initially a parking lot of **content** to be distributed among various eventual FSA Design System and Playbook sites.

## Building locally

Install local dependencies...

```sh
bundle install
```

...and then...

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

...and after  then navigate to http://localhost:4000

### Troubleshooting

If you're getting weird "Kramdown" error messaging...
```sh
gem install kramdown
```
...and then try this again...

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

...and then navigate to http://localhost:4000/fsa-playbook-wip/

If it's something else, reach out to me.
