### 1. Start with user needs.

* Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: who is going to read this? What do they need to know? How might they be feeling?
* Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the process.

### 2. Do the hard work to make it simple.

* Use plain language and simple sentences.
* Choose clarity over cleverness.

### 3. Write for everyone.

* Respect the complexity of our users’ experiences.
* Be willing to be surprised about who’s reading your work.

### 4. Build trust.

* Talk like a person.
* Tell the truth.
* Use positive language and concrete examples.

### 5. Start small and iterate.

* Make sure your content works for users. Don’t be afraid to scrap what’s there and start over.
* Write a draft, test it with real users, gather feedback, and keep refining.
